# Weather-Journal App

## Overview
A simple asynchronous web app that uses an external Web API [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org) and some user data to fill a very simple weather journal.

## Instructions
The server can be run locally with Node.js. It requires packages _express_, _cors_ and _body-parser_ to be installed on your machine.

To start up the server, run `node server.js` in the project's root directory. The server will then be listening on port `3030`.
